# Javascript Playground
This repository contains a series of JavaScript projects that I've created while learning the language on Scrimba(https://v2.scrimba.com/home). Thanks to Scrimba for providing an excellent learning platform and awesome projects! Each project focuses on different concepts and techniques, aiming to solidify my understanding of JavaScript.

### Projects
